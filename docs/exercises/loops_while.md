## Loops - `while`

1. Create a program that calculates mean value of numbers. Number of input values is not known in advance. User terminates number input by entering *0*. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_401.py)
2. Create a program that asks user _"What is the result of 2\*2?"_ and lets guess until user enters correct answer. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_402.py)
3. Improve previous program by limiting number of guesses to 3. Program has to output answer if user did not guess correctly. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_403.py)
4. Create a program that tells if a number id part of Fibonacci sequence and what is its index in the sequence. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_404.py)
5. Create a program that calculates page count in a book if user enters sum of all page numbers. Output a message if it's not possible. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_405.py)
6. Find the first digit of a natural number. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_406.py)
7. Find number of digits in a natural number. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_407.py)
8. Find sum of all numbers in a natural number. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_408.py)
9. Find how many *5* are in a natural number. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_409.py)
10. Find out if *5* is present in a natural number. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_410.py)
11. Calculate value of *sin x* using Taylor's series. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_411.py)<br>
x - x<sup>3</sup>/3! + x<sup>5</sup>/5! - x<sup>7</sup>/7!
12. Print items of the following sequence. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/loops_while/e_412.py)<br>
a<sub>n+1</sub> = a<sub>n</sub>/2 *# When a<sub>n</sub> is even*<br>
a<sub>n+1</sub> = 3\*a<sub>n</sub> + 1 *# When a<sub>n</sub> is odd*
