2. Find all *th* in the text. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/count_sum/e_302.py)
3. Calculate mean of given numbers. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/count_sum/e_303.py)
4. Count how many numbers are positive and how many are negative. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/count_sum/e_304.py)
5. Calculate factorial of a number. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/count_sum/e_305.py)<br>
_n! = 1 \* 2 \* 3 \* ... \* n_
6. Calculate sum of the sequence. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/count_sum/e_306.py)<br>
_1<sup>2</sup> - 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> - 4<sup>2</sup> + ... + (-1)<sup>n+1</sup> \* n<sup>2</sup>_.
7. Calculate _sin x_ using Taylor Series. [Solution](https://github.com/pr-kaspars/python-lessons/tree/master/docs/exercises/solutions/count_sum/e_307.py)<br>
_x - x<sup>3</sup>/3! + x<sup>5</sup>/5! + ... + (-1)<sup>n+1</sup>\*x<sup>2n+1</sup>/(2n+1)!_.
