# Loops

## Exercise

1. Create a program that draws circles in a vertical line.
2. Create a program that draws circles in 45 degree line in both directions.
3. Create a program that draw concentric circles with center.
in the middle of the window. Radius of the smallest circle
is 5 pixels, every next radius is 5 pixels bigger. Largest
circle touches edge of the window.
4. Update previous program so that gaps between circles are
filled with blue and red colours
5. Create a program that draws vertical lines from left
to right. The length of the line must be 10 pixels and
distance between them 10 pixels.
6. Create a programs that draws a row of diagonal lines that
cross in the middle.
7. Update previous program to draw several lines of crossing
lines.
8. Create a program that draws several lines of right-angled
triangles. Firs line has one triangle, second - two triangles
third - three, etc.
9. Create a program that fills the window with squares and
paint them as chess board.
10. Create a program that draws 1000 random points in
random colours.
11. Create a program that draws jagged line with random
vertices.
12. Create a program that draws 100 circles with random
centre, radius and colours.
13. Create a program that draws 100 random rectangles.
